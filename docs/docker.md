# Install and use docker

**_source_**: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04

**_prerequisites_**: [connecting with ssh](./ssh) and [initial server setup](./initial-setup)

## Installing Docker with APT

_**APT** is Ubuntu's default package manager. Run `man apt` in your Ubuntu environment (your server) to view the manual page documentation or search duckduckgo to learn more about it_

Before we install docker, we'll setup our server to:
1. download docker from Docker's official repository (because Ubuntu's default repository might not have the latest version)
2. cryptographically validate what we download from Docker's repository by adding Docker's GPG key.

- [x] First, download the latest package information from all configured sources.
```
# sudo apt update
```
- [x] Next, install packages which let `apt` use HTTPS (you may already have these installed)
```
# sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
```
- [x] Then add the official Docker repository GPG key
```
# curl -fsSl https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
- [x] Add the Docker repository to APT sources. This will update our list of available packages to include those available from the Docker repository
```
sudo add-apt-reository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
```
- [x] Verify that APT is configured to download Docker from the official Docker repository and not Ubuntu's default package repo
```
# apt-cache policy docker-ce
```
You'll want to see something like this
```
docker-ce:
  Installed: (none)
  Candidate: 5:20.10.11~3-0~ubuntu-focal
  Version table:
    5:20.10.11~3-0~ubuntu-focal 500
      500 https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal/stable amd64 Packages
```

- [x] Finally, we're ready to install Docker
```
# sudo apt install docker-ce
```
Docker should now be installed, the daemon started, and the process enabled to start on boot.

- [x] Verify that itâ€™s running
```
# sudo systemctl status docker
```
The `docker` CLI should now be available. Follow the steps in the next section to use it without `sudo`
